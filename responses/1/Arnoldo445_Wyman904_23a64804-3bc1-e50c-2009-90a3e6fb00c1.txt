Patient 23a64804-3bc1-e50c-2009-90a3e6fb00c1, Mr. Arnoldo445 Wyman904, a male born on September 4, 1978, residing at 240 Runolfsdottir Approach, Ord, NE 68862, presents with a detailed medical history spanning several decades.

In 1978, Mr. Wyman904 was born, and subsequent medical records show regular physical exams and medication reviews. His medical history remained largely unremarkable until 1993 when he reported experiencing higher levels of stress, which coincided with his full-time employment. This stress continued to be a recurrent issue in subsequent years.

In 2001, Mr. Wyman904's stress-related symptoms prompted further evaluation, and he was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 score of 7). His medication was reviewed at this time, and he received appropriate treatment.

In 2013, Mr. Wyman904 experienced a period of not being in the labor force, possibly due to the ongoing stress and anxiety. His GAD-7 score improved to 0, indicating effective management.

However, in 2020, there was a notable increase in his body weight, reaching a BMI of 30.11 kg/m2, classifying him as obese. His blood pressure also increased (98/122 mm[Hg]), and cholesterol levels were elevated. He reported ongoing stress (GAD-7 score of 3) and had a DAST-10 score of 2, suggesting the need for continued assessment of substance use.

In 2021 and 2022, Mr. Wyman904 received COVID-19 vaccinations. His GAD-7 score increased to 3 in 2022, indicating a resurgence of anxiety symptoms. However, his DAST-10 score improved to 1, suggesting better control over substance use.

1. **Medication Review**: Conduct a thorough review of Mr. Wyman904's current medications to assess their effectiveness and adjust as necessary to manage his anxiety and stress levels.

2. **Lifestyle Modification**: Encourage Mr. Wyman904 to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including dietary changes and regular exercise, to address his obesity and improve his overall well-being.

3. **Stress Management**: Refer Mr. Wyman904 to a mental health professional for stress management strategies and therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, to better manage his anxiety.

4. **Substance Use Assessment**: Continue monitoring Mr. Wyman904's substance use habits and provide appropriate interventions or referrals if necessary.

5. **Regular Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to track his progress and adjust treatment plans as needed.

6. **Immunizations**: Ensure that Mr. Wyman904 stays up to date with recommended immunizations, especially in light of his recent COVID-19 vaccinations.
