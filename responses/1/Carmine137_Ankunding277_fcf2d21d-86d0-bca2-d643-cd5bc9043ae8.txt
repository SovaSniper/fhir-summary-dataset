3. **Mental Health Support**: The patient has a history of stress, anxiety, and potential trauma. A mental health assessment and therapy should be offered to address these issues. Referral to a mental health specialist may be necessary.

4. **Social Support**: The patient's history of limited social contact and social isolation should be acknowledged. Encouraging social engagement and support systems is crucial for overall well-being.

5. **Safety Assessment**: Given the history of potential intimate partner abuse and traumatic experiences, a safety assessment and appropriate interventions, such as counseling and legal support, should be considered.

6. **Regular Follow-up**: The patient should be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

7. **Health Education**: Provide the patient with education on lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and the importance of regular check-ups.
