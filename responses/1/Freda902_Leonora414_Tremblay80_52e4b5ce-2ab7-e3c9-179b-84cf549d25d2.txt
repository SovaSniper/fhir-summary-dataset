Patient 52e4b5ce-2ab7-e3c9-179b-84cf549d25d2, also known as Freda902 Tremblay80, is a 34-year-old female residing at 351 Corwin Station, Burlington, VT 05408. Her medical history reveals several key findings and diagnoses over the years.

**Medical History:**
1. In 2007, she was diagnosed with prediabetes and anemia. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) indicated obesity (BMI: 31.64 kg/m2). She reported a pain severity score of 3/10. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were within normal ranges. Glucose levels were slightly elevated at 68.99 mg/dL.

2. In 2014, she underwent sterilization. She also completed immunizations for influenza in 2014 and 2016.

3. In 2016, Freda902 was diagnosed with acute bronchitis. Her BMI remained in the obese range (30.42 kg/m2), and she reported a pain severity score of 3/10. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were stable. Glucose levels were elevated at 72.61 mg/dL.

4. In October 2020, she presented with sepsis and cystitis, requiring treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and norepinephrine. Her blood pressure fluctuated, and lactate levels were elevated.

**Current Health Status:**
As of her latest visit in July 2023, Freda902 is in full-time employment. Her BMI remains in the obese range (31.04 kg/m2). Blood pressure and vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated heart rate (84/min). Her glucose levels are also elevated at 95.64 mg/dL. She continues to report mild anxiety (GAD-7 score: 1/21) and has completed recent immunizations.

**Clinical Recommendations:**
1. Given her persistent obesity and elevated glucose levels, it is essential to address her prediabetic condition. She should receive regular follow-ups with a focus on lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.

2. Anxiety management and mental health support should be provided based on her GAD-7 scores. Consider counseling or therapy as needed.

3. Blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular risk assessment should continue due to her obesity and elevated glucose levels. Encourage her to maintain a healthy lifestyle and monitor her cholesterol levels, as elevated BMI is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

4. Freda902 should receive annual influenza immunizations and stay up-to-date with recommended vaccinations.

5. Routine follow-ups should include glucose monitoring, BMI assessment, and mental health evaluations to track her progress and provide timely interventions.

6. Educate her about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and dietary choices to manage her prediabetes and reduce her risk of developing diabetes.

7. Encourage her to seek counseling or support groups for her anxiety, and offer appropriate therapies or medications if necessary.

Freda902 Tremblay80's ongoing care should focus on preventing diabetes, managing her anxiety, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to improve her overall health and well-being. Regular follow-ups and monitoring are crucial for her long-term health.
