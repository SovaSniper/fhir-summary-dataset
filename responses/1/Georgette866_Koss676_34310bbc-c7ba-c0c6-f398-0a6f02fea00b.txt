Patient 34310bbc-c7ba-c0c6-f398-0a6f02fea00b, Georgette Koss676, born on February 21, 1980, resided at 871 Shanahan Parade, Poultney, VT 05764. Georgette had a well-documented medical history. Her initial measurements at birth were a height of 51 cm and a weight of 4.1 kg. The pain severity, reported on a 0-10 scale, was 3. 

Throughout her early years, Georgette showed steady growth and development. At her most recent visit, on October 30, 1980, she measured 72.4 cm in height and weighed 10 kg. Pain severity was reported at 2, indicating a moderate level of discomfort.

Georgette's head occipital-frontal circumference followed a percentile of 41.14%, with a final measurement of 44.6 cm. Her blood pressure ranged from 85/141 mm[Hg] to 83/138 mm[Hg] over the observed period. Heart rate varied from 67 to 95 beats per minute, and respiratory rate remained within a normal range of 12 to 16 breaths per minute.

Laboratory values indicated normal hematological parameters. Notably, her leukocyte count was 7.4024 10*3/uL, erythrocyte count was 5.2377 10*6/uL, hemoglobin level was 12.957 g/dL, and hematocrit was 39.632%. Platelet counts remained stable around 399.61 10*3/uL.

Georgette received timely immunizations, including Hib (PRP-OMP), IPV, MMR, and Hep B, in accordance with her pediatric schedule.

Unfortunately, Georgette was diagnosed with a seizure disorder and experienced a single seizure event. She was subsequently diagnosed with epilepsy. This necessitated ongoing monitoring and treatment.
