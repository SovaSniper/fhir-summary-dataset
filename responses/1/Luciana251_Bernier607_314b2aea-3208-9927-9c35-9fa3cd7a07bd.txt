**Clinical Summary for Patient 314b2aea-3208-9927-9c35-9fa3cd7a07bd (Bernier607, Luciana251)**

*Patient Information:*
Name: Luciana Bernier
Gender: Female
Date of Birth: February 12, 1997
Address: 853 Walker Harbor, Shoreview, MN 55127

*Medical History:*
Ms. Bernier, a 26-year-old female, presents with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). She has been experiencing symptoms since her late teens, leading to periodic medication reviews. Additionally, she reported mild symptoms of depression as evidenced by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 and PHQ-2), both scoring low. Her overall physical health has been stable, with variations in weight and blood pressure noted over the years. Notably, she underwent a normal pregnancy in 2016 and continues to be monitored regularly.

*Present Situation:*
Ms. Bernier's recent observations indicate a stable condition, with her GAD-7 score persistently low. Her BMI has increased slightly to 24.3 kg/m² due to a weight gain to 58.7 kg. Blood pressure remains within the normal range but slightly elevated, suggesting the need for lifestyle modifications. She reported increased pain severity (score of 4), which may require further investigation. Despite her anxiety, Ms. Bernier maintains positive immunization compliance, including the recent SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines.

*Recommendations and Course of Action:*
1. **Anxiety Management:** Given the persistent but mild anxiety symptoms, continued monitoring of her GAD-7 score is advised. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques can be explored as non-pharmacological interventions. Regular follow-ups with a mental health professional are crucial.

2. **Physical Health:** Ms. Bernier should focus on a balanced diet and regular physical activity to address the slight increase in BMI. A consult with a nutritionist and exercise specialist would be beneficial. Monitoring her blood pressure is crucial; lifestyle modifications, such as reducing sodium intake and increasing physical activity, should be emphasized.

3. **Pain Management:** The recent increase in reported pain severity (score 4) warrants further investigation. A consultation with a pain specialist or a rheumatologist may be necessary to identify the cause and establish an appropriate pain management plan.

4. **Psychosocial Support:** Considering her history of anxiety, any social isolation or stress should be addressed promptly. Support groups and therapy sessions could provide valuable coping strategies.

5. **Medication Review:** Given the persistent anxiety symptoms, a review of her current medications, their efficacy, and potential adjustments should be considered. Collaboration between her mental health provider and primary care physician is vital.

6. **Future Follow-ups:** Regular follow-up appointments every 3-6 months, alternating between her mental health provider and primary care physician, are essential. These appointments should include assessments of her anxiety symptoms, pain severity, and overall well-being.

*Conclusion:*
Ms. Bernier presents with a history of generalized anxiety disorder, with recent indications of increased pain severity. A comprehensive approach involving mental health support, lifestyle modifications, and medical evaluations is crucial. Regular follow-ups and a multidisciplinary approach will ensure the best possible care and overall well-being for the patient.
