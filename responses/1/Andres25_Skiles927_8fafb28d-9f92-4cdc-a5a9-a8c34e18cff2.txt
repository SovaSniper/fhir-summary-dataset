4. **Substance Use**: Keep an eye on substance use patterns, as indicated by the DAST-10 scores. Provide resources for substance abuse treatment if needed.

5. **Social Support**: Given the history of stress and exposure to violence, ensure the patient has access to social support networks and consider counseling or therapy to address any trauma.

6. **Lifestyle Modification**: Encourage lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and physical activity, to address elevated lipid levels.
