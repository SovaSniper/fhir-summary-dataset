**Treatment Course:**
Marlena558 is not currently on any specific medications except for the Etonogestrel implant.

3. **Cholesterol Management:** Initiate lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, to manage elevated cholesterol levels. Consider statin therapy based on cardiovascular risk assessment.

4. **Follow-up Investigations:** Regular monitoring of cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and mental health assessments at scheduled intervals. Periodic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.

5. **Patient Education:** Provide detailed information to Marlena558 regarding lifestyle modifications, mental health management strategies, and the importance of medication adherence. Encourage engagement with social activities to address social isolation.
